SlimDotEnv
==========

Loads environment variables from `.env` to `getenv()`, `$_ENV` and
`$_SERVER`

This is an extension of Vance Lucas's [PHPDotEnv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)

SlimDotEnv extends PHPDotEnv to allow default valuse in the .env file

Slim was added to the name only because I was working on a Slim Framework project when I created it.
